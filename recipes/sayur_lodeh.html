        Sayur lodeh is a traditional Indonesian vegetable curry, beloved for its rich coconut milk base and fragrant spices. Typically, it features a mix of vegetables such as eggplant, chayote, green beans, cabbage, and tofu, all simmered in a mildly spiced broth flavored with garlic, shallots, galangal, lemongrass, and turmeric. Creamy yet light, sayur lodeh balances sweet, savory, and aromatic notes. It’s often served with rice or lontong (compressed rice cakes), making it a comforting, everyday staple.
