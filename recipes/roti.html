        Oyakodon is a classic Japanese rice bowl dish whose name means “parent-and-child donburi,” 
        symbolizing its main ingredients: chicken and egg. Tender chicken pieces and onions are simmered in a savory-sweet broth of dashi, 
        soy sauce, and mirin, then topped with gently cooked beaten eggs for a silky texture. Served over steamed rice, oyakodon is both hearty and comforting, 
        balancing sweet and savory flavors in a simple, homestyle meal that highlights the essence of Japanese comfort food.
